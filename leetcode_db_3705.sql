Table: restaurant_orders

+------------------+----------+
| Column Name      | Type     | 
+------------------+----------+
| order_id         | int      |
| customer_id      | int      |
| order_timestamp  | datetime |
| order_amount     | decimal  |
| payment_method   | varchar  |
| order_rating     | int      |
+------------------+----------+
order_id is the unique identifier for this table.
payment_method can be cash, card, or app.
order_rating is between 1 and 5, where 5 is the best (NULL if not rated).
order_timestamp contains both date and time information.
Write a solution to find golden hour customers - customers who consistently order during peak hours and provide high satisfaction. A customer is a golden hour customer if they meet ALL the following criteria:

Made at least 3 orders.
At least 60% of their orders are during peak hours (11:00-14:00 or 18:00-21:00).
Their average rating for rated orders is at least 4.0, round it to 2 decimal places.
Have rated at least 50% of their orders.
Return the result table ordered by average_rating in descending order, then by customer_id​​​​​​​ in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example:

Input:

restaurant_orders table:

Explanation:

Customer 101:
Total orders: 4 (at least 3) 
Peak hour orders: 4 out of 4 (12:30, 19:15, 13:45, and 20:30 are in peak hours)
Peak hour percentage: 100% (at least 60%) 
Rated orders: 3 out of 4 (75% rating completion) 
Average rating: (5+4+5)/3 = 4.67 (at least 4.0) 
Result: Golden hour customer
Customer 102:
Total orders: 3 (at least 3) 
Peak hour orders: 2 out of 3 (11:30, 12:00 are in peak hours; 15:30 is not)
Peak hour percentage: 2/3 = 66.67% (at least 60%) 
Rated orders: 2 out of 3 (66.67% rating completion) 
Average rating: (4+3)/2 = 3.5 (less than 4.0) 
Result: Not a golden hour customer (average rating too low)
Customer 103:
Total orders: 3 (at least 3) 
Peak hour orders: 3 out of 3 (19:00, 20:45, 18:30 all in evening peak)
Peak hour percentage: 3/3 = 100% (at least 60%) 
Rated orders: 3 out of 3 (100% rating completion) 
Average rating: (5+4+5)/3 = 4.67 (at least 4.0) 
Result: Golden hour customer
Customer 104:
Total orders: 3 (at least 3) 
Peak hour orders: 0 out of 3 (10:00, 09:30, 16:00 all outside peak hours)
Peak hour percentage: 0/3 = 0% (less than 60%) 
Result: Not a golden hour customer (insufficient peak hour orders)
Customer 105:
Total orders: 3 (at least 3) 
Peak hour orders: 3 out of 3 (12:15, 13:00, 11:45 all in lunch peak)
Peak hour percentage: 3/3 = 100% (at least 60%) 
Rated orders: 3 out of 3 (100% rating completion) 
Average rating: (4+5+4)/3 = 4.33 (at least 4.0) 
Result: Golden hour customer
The results table is ordered by average_rating DESC, then customer_id DESC.
